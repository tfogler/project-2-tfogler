Use this notebook to quickly write the methods for the week:

### Methods:
Sample files were downloaded from the accession link, in .fastq format. 
Then we did basic quality control with FASTQC, running on each in turn.
Once the quality was deemed satisfactory, trimmomatic was run to remove
low-quality score subsequences and the adapter RNA sequences from the 
sample files.
An index was made from the gencode Human primary assembly genome "GRCh38" 
using bowtie2 v2.5.3 with default options. 




If asked, you may also include any plots or figures in this notebook as well:
